                <h3>MADE THE HARD WAY</h3>
                <p> We are a family of creators – close knit and a little crazy – handcrafting goods at our workshop in Portland, Oregon. We love what we do, and when work matters, it just keeps getting better. Our process is uncompromising, because we believe every product is a representation of who we are. </p>

                <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
                <img src="img/about.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>Grovemade began with friendship and the spirit to create. We’re a small workshop of designers, craftsmen, and support staff who enjoy our work, function like a family, and always strive to do better. Caring about how we do things here makes us better at what we do. Our focus is to make a few things really well. We’ve found putting people first leads to the best products. And, frankly, it’s just more fun this way!</p>

                <h3>FOUNDERS</h3>
                <img src="img/founders.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>Grovemade was founded by friends Joe Mansfield and Ken Tomita in 2009. Their workshops were across the street from one another, and they would often toss a football in the street, brainstorming and trying to one-up each other’s design ideas. Joe worked in digital art and laser engraving, and Ken worked in furniture design and fabrication. These fields merged to create a company focused on art, design, craftsmanship, and natural materials.</p>
